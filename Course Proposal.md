# Course Proposal

The course is meant to be a very practical one and focus on tranmisting some of the best practices and development patterns while   writing API / Backend applications. The idea is to provide a basic theoretical background and then guide people in the process of writing a very minimal but functional API application. 

Since the course it's intended to be very pratical and G.S.D-centered we should have at least 2 experienced developers on the subject, so that they can assist others and help with questions that might arise throughout the development process.

Also before starting the course, we need to understand the developers that will be attending to it. In this sense we've created a survey so that we can capture as much information as possible from the target audience:

- How would you rate your knowledge of the Python Language (User selects a number from 1 to 10)
- How would you rate your experience in writing Backend/API applications (User selects a number from 1 to 10)
- How would you rate your knowledge of Docker (User selects a number from 1 to 10)
- How would you rate your knowledgen on writing API/Backend applications (Use selects a number from 1 to 10)
- What would be your preferred approach to teaching the course (User selects among the following options:

    1 - Hit me with a lot of theory, 
    
    2 - I just want to G.S.D 
    
    3- A good balance between Theory and G.S.D)


## Part One - Intro
- Frameworks for writing APIs/Backend applications (in Python)
- What do we need/want from a Framework
- Things to keep in mind while writing APIs
- Introduction to Flask
- Introduction to Docker
- 12 Factor application (no need to elaborate on it but make sure that we mention it and also every time we use on of the 12 principles in the App make sure we say that's it's a 12 Factor thing)

# Part One - The App
- Introduce the App
- Write the first endpoint  (TDD/BDD) -> Need help here from someone
- Test the first endpoint
- Write more endpoints
- Databases / Hexagonal architecture
- Workers and asynchronous processing 

## Second part (Shipping to production):

- Continuous integration
- Continuous deployment
- Available Cloud? solutions 
- The deployment Pipeline
- Logging 
- Monitoring 

## Third part (Microservices)??? - I could help but my experience is mainly theoretical â€¦ or not at scale ...
