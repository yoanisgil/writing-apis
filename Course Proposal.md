# Course Proposal

The course is meant to be very practical and focus on tranmisting some of the best practices and development patterns while   writing API / Backend applications. The idea is to provide a minimal theoretical background and then guide people in the process of writing a very minimal but functional API application. 

## Part One - Intro
- Frameworks for writing APIs/Backend applications (in Python)
- What do we need/want from a Framework
- Things to keep in mind while writing APIs
- Introduction to Flask
- Introduction to Docker
- 12 Factor application (no need to elaborate on it but make sure that we mention it and also every time we use on of the 12 principles in the App make sure we say that's it's a 12 Factor thing)

# Part One - The App
- Introduce the App
- Write the first endpoint  (TDD/BDD) -> Need help here from someone
- Test the first endpoint
- Write more endpoints
- Databases / Hexagonal architecture
- Workers and asynchronous processing 

## Second part (Shipping to production):

- Continuous integration
- Continuous deployment
- Available Cloud? solutions 
- The deployment Pipeline
- Logging 
- Monitoring 

## Third part (Microservices)??? - I could help but my experience is mainly theoretical â€¦ or not at scale ...
